# To Do List using Log-in functionality

For this one day project, Bradley Smith and I worked together on producing an app with the ability for users to log in. We were given the option of any app, so long as we used a service to provide authorisation to our app.

As a solution we decided to create a to do list app that used [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) services for our log in functionality.

## Instructions

If git cloning, please do an NPM install in your terminal followed by NPM run start.

## Future Goals

- Deploy the app.
- Refactor code and add comments.
